#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
join_data <- left_join(filter(covidseasonality::covid_data, country == "Australia"), 
                       filter(covidseasonality::world, region == "Australia"), 
                       by = c("country" = "region"))

join_data %>% 
  filter(country == "Australia") %>% 
  plot_countries_hemis()
