`covidseasonality` package contains all the tools needed to make the its corresponding `Shiny` app. This package aims to improve the app's accessibility and readability. It also provides a means to review seasonal change in cases across the world. 

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of covidseasonality from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("covidseasonality") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You could install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-brenwin1")
```
## Example

This is a basic example what the package includes  

inbuilt datasets with countries in the Tropics, Northern and Southern Hemisphere. 
```{r dataset-eg}
library(covidseasonality)
library(tibble)

Northern_hemis # countries in the Northern Hemisphere
```

Takes data frame and plots daily cases against date with shaded area indicating winter months. Now you can extend this to include countries in the world. 
```{r plot-eg, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
join_data <- left_join(filter(covidseasonality::covid_data, country == "Australia"), 
                       filter(covidseasonality::world, region == "Australia"), 
                       by = c("country" = "region"))

join_data %>% 
  filter(country == "Australia") %>% 
  covidseasonality::plot_countries_hemis()
```
