`covidseasonality` package aims to assess the novel coronavirus seasonality effects by examining the cases in each hemisphere as cold weather migrates to the Northern Hemisphere. Also, it improves its corresponding app's accessibility and readability. 

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of covidseasonality from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("covidseasonality") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-brenwin1")
```

## Get Started

This is a some basic examples what the package does  

Access inbuilt datasets such as countries in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere and Tropics
```{r dataset-eg}
library(covidseasonality)
library(tibble)

Northern_hemis # countries in the Northern Hemisphere
```

Takes inbuilt data sets and plot daily cases against date with shaded area indicating winter months. Now you can extend this to include countries in the world. 
```{r plot-eg, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
library(dplyr)
join_data <- covidseasonality::country_list %>% 
  filter(country == "Australia") %>% 
  covidseasonality::join_data()

join_data %>% 
  covidseasonality::plot_countries_hemis()
```

Provide summaries of total cases and total cases per 100,000 of the country's population. 
```{r summary_table, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
join_data(join_data) %>% 
  summary_table() 
```

It can also launch the app with a single function. Furthermore, there are also inbuilt functions that controls the inputs of the app.
```{r}
# not run
# covidseasonality::launch_app()
```
